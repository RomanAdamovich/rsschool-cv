## About me
   I think that only actions and deeds can tell about what kind of person you are)) Describe yourself in hackneyed words like purposeful, stress-resistant, etc. anyone can, but life is different. I can only say that in my work I love it when the result is visible, when it is interesting, a good environment. Also in my free time I like to relax in nature, participate in outdoor sports, I love animals and of course my family. Now I want to enter IT to change my current field of activity. I study programming languages, as well as English. Thank you for visiting my page)))
